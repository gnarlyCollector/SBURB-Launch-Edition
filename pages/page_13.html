		<p>Atop it sit your MAGNIFYING GLASS which you use for all sorts of hard boiled investigations, as well as your trusty FINGERPRINT KIT. You never did get much use out of it on your several sleuthing escapades of which you've certainly for sure taken part in. Beside it lies the shell of one of your STARBOTS. They are your most loyal helpers and your proudest mechanical marvel yet. They wouldn't be able to run without proper programming from one of your friends whom you chat with on TROLLIAN often. <br><br>Speaking of which, you should probably check in with them.
