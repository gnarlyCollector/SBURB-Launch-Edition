  <span class="jd">CT: Hey!</span> <br>
  <span class="kase">CC: Hi JD!</span> <br>
  <span class="jd">CT: Big day tomorrow! You excited???</span> <br>
  <span class="kase">CC: Oh shit, that IS tomorrow isn't it? Of course I am! I bet you're even more excited than any of us, haha. Double excitement!</span> <br>
  <span class="jd">CT: I mean I guess? I feel like I’m- like- only half as excited as AC but sure. Am I SUPPOSED to be double excited or something? Ya kinda lost me.</span> <br>
  <span class="kase">CC: ...</span> <br>
  <span class="kase">CC: Tomorrow.</span> <br>
  <span class="kase">CC: July 20th.</span> <br>
  <span class="kase">CC: Any specific events ringing any bells????</span> <br>
  <span class="jd">CT: Uh… The launch day? Right?</span> <br>
  <span class="jd">CT: ...</span> <br>
  <span class="jd">CT: OH!!! DUH!!! Some detective I’ll turn out to be if I forget my own effing birthday.</span> <br>
  <span class="kase">CC: Lmao. How does it feel to be joining the "adult" club?? :O</span> <br>
  <span class="kase">CC: Heavy sarcastic emphasis on adult. Imagine I used more quotations.</span> <br>
  <span class="jd">CT: Hey I so TOO can be adult! I tidied up my recuperacoon and everything this morning! I’m adulting before I’m even an adult!!</span> <br>
  <span class="kase">CC: Kudos! I more meant it like... 18 barely feels like an adult. Real shit starts at 21!</span> <br>
  <span class="jd">CT: Maybe where YOU live. In the Troll kingdom I can legally access soporific materials the second that clock hits midnight! Sucks to be you ;P</span> <br>
  <span class="kase">CC: Aw, lucky!</span> <br>
  <span class="jd">CT: I mean, I’ll never use them. If you transportalize over to my respiteblock I can easily hook you up though. I couldn’t imagine getting between a girl and her booze.</span> <br>
  <span class="kase">CC: Hehehe! In actuality though, I probably wouldn't even end up drinking anything. That shit kinda tastes like ass.</span> <br>
  <span class="jd">CT: We’re getting tangential here, when are we getting in line tonight?</span> <br>
  <span class="kase">CC: Oooh.. good question! There will probably be a TON of people there, plus we gotta factor in travel time. I'd say maybe... 9 PM-ish? We'll be waiting a bit, but I'm pretty sure there is a McDonalds near the game store.</span> <br>
  <span class="kase">CC: We need to make sure that works for TT though! I assume AC can't make it right?</span> <br>
  <span class="jd">CT: Man, I never know with AC. He’s always so... “instinctual” about everything. He’ll just go when it feels right and like- it’ll probably work out fine for him. Who knows, maybe he’ll be the 4,130th customer and they’ll give it to him for free. Whoopdee doo, the crowd goes wild or something.</span> <br>
  <span class="kase">CC: Wait, is that an actual promotion?!</span> <br>
  <span class="jd">CT: <img src="../images/brug.jpg" width="200" height="auto" /></span> <br>
  <span class="jd">CT: Anyway, yeah, 9 probably works. Travel time to a transportalizer should only take me 10ish minutes. I’ll just use the one by the boathouse.</span> <br>
  <span class="kase">CC: My travel time will probably be nearly an hour. Oof. Hopefully my mom wont flip out over it…</span> <br>
  <span class="jd">CT: Imagine not having a lusus</span> <br>

  <span class="kase">CC: Uh huh. I'd take a fuckin' potato chip over my mom.</span> <br>
  <span class="kase">CC: Anyway!</span> <br>
  <span class="jd">CT: Yeah, uh, sorry. Didn’t mean to hit a nerve there. Here, I’ll pester AC about it, you wanna ask TT about his plan?</span> <br>
  <span class="kase">CC: No worries, and sure! I'm crossing my fingers we're all able to wait together!! :3</span> <br>
  <span class="jd">CT: Yeah, it’s been too long since I’ve seen y’all! Talk to ya later!</span> <br>
  <span class="kase">CC: Yeah I'll see you!</span> <br>
